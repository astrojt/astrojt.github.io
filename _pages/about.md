I'm a third year DPhil (PhD) student working with Patrick Irwin, Suzanne Aigrain and Vivien Parmentier. I use the NEMESIS code to perform retrieval analysis of exoplanet atmospheres. My current project is focused on analysing the emission spectra of hot Jupiters, with the goal to develop techniques to best analyse them with the arrival of the James Webb Space Telescope, and how to mitigate biases we will face when analysing the new data with current retrieval techniques.

In my spare time, I am a trustee for an LGBT+ charitable trust called Pride in STEM. We aim to showcase and support all LGBT+ people in STEM fields, for more information, see our website: https://prideinstem.org/
