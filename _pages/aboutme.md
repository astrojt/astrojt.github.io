## Research Interests

## Pride in STEM
In my spare time, I am a trustee for an LGBT+ charitable trust called Pride in STEM. We aim to showcase and support all LGBT+ people in STEM fields, for more information, see our [website](https://prideinstem.org)!

I have organised Out Thinkers events in Oxford and helped to organise others in London. These are events in which LGBT+ people in STEM can get together to showcase their work in a relaxed environment. This was birthed out of the desire to "Science up queer spaces". To see some of the talks that have been given in the past, [click here!](https://prideinstem.org/out-thinkers/)

Our work has been internationally recognised. We have had articles written about us in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02022-8?utm_source=twt_nnc&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=naturenews&sf215296903=1) and [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48884806). We have also been part of the development and organisation of #LGBTSTEMday which has had the support from a lot of science organisations includning [ESA](https://twitter.com/esa/status/1147069791041142784?s=20) and [CERN](https://home.cern/news/news/cern/celebrating-diversity-science).
