## Research Interests

## Pride in STEM
In my spare time, I am a trustee for an LGBT+ charitable trust called Pride in STEM. We aim to showcase and support all LGBT+ people in STEM fields, for more information, see our [website](https://prideinstem.org)!

I have organised Out Thinkers events in Oxford and helped to organise others in London. These are events in which LGBT+ people in STEM can get together to showcase their work in a relaxed environment. This was birthed out of the desire to "Science up queer spaces". To see some of the talks that have been given in the past, [click here!](https://prideinstem.org/out-thinkers/)
